StarGenerator

This is the ongoing work of transferring my StarCreator Excel document into a Java application. Still unsure of it's final form. Probably inte will be a desktop application delivering a cluster of stars and planet systems with complete physical characteristics and also populated with biology (where applicable) and civilisations.

Inspired by GURPS Traveller with additional information from multiple sources (list will provided later).

This is a new direction with a Graphic User Interface using JavaFX (due to IDE shenaigans I feel it was best to start a new repository).

2017-08-11 Still a unnumbered work in progress.
